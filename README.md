Dr. Ilker KaradaÄŸ is an Associate Professor in Architecture, specializing in sustainable design, machine learning, and environmental analysis. He earned his bachelorâ€™s degree in architecture in 2010 and began his masterâ€™s studies in the same year at Middle East Technical University (METU), Department of Architecture, Building Sciences Program. He continued as a research assistant in the same program from 2011. In 2013, he completed his masterâ€™s thesis on natural ventilation in tall buildings. 

In 2014, he commenced his doctoral studies at Istanbul Technical University (ITU), Faculty of Architecture, Building Sciences Program, working as a research assistant at the Chair of Building Physics and Environmental Control. During his doctoral research, he developed ArchPLUS, software enabling wind analysis in an augmented reality environment. He has authored numerous articles and papers in sustainable architecture and artificial intelligence. After completing his PhD, he developed ArchiDynamics software, which has gained international recognition. 

In 2023, he received a national patent for an experimental setup he developed. His research interests include machine learning, sustainable design and development, augmented reality, virtual reality, mixed reality, and computational fluid dynamics. ArchiDynamics is an award-winning environmental analysis software developed by Dr. KaradaÄŸ. It offers real-time wind, solar, daylight, fire, context, and climate analysis tools, integrating seamlessly with design platforms like Revit, Grasshopper, and SketchUp. This integration allows architects to conduct comprehensive environmental analyses efficiently during the design process. In 2023, Dr. KaradaÄŸ received a national patent for an experimental wind analysis setup he developed, further advancing his contributions to architectural research and practice. The High Performance Building Labâ€™s transdisciplinary approach to transforming design decision-making aligns with his research objectives. He is particularly interested in exploring how machine learning can enhance wind analysis methodologies, contributing to the development of sustainable buildings and cities.
