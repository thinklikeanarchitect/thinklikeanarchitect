Dr. Ilker Karadağ is an Associate Professor in Architecture, specializing in sustainable design, machine learning, and environmental analysis. He earned his bachelor’s degree in architecture in 2010 and began his master’s studies in the same year at Middle East Technical University (METU), Department of Architecture, Building Sciences Program. He continued as a research assistant in the same program from 2011. In 2013, he completed his master’s thesis on natural ventilation in tall buildings. 

In 2014, he commenced his doctoral studies at Istanbul Technical University (ITU), Faculty of Architecture, Building Sciences Program, working as a research assistant at the Chair of Building Physics and Environmental Control. During his doctoral research, he developed ArchPLUS, software enabling wind analysis in an augmented reality environment. He has authored numerous articles and papers in sustainable architecture and artificial intelligence. After completing his PhD, he developed ArchiDynamics software, which has gained international recognition. 

His research interests include machine learning, sustainable design and development, augmented reality, virtual reality, mixed reality, and computational fluid dynamics. In 2023, Dr. Karadağ received a patent for an experimental wind analysis setup he developed, further advancing his contributions to architectural research and practice. He was also recently recognized in the August 2025 update of Stanford’s science-wide author citation impact list, highlighting his contributions to architecture, building, and urban simulation research. The Sustainable Urban System Lab’s transdisciplinary approach to transforming design decision-making aligns with his research objectives. He is particularly interested in exploring how machine learning can enhance wind analysis methodologies, contributing to the development of sustainable buildings and cities.
